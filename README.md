# C# Programming Exercises

This repository contains a set of introductory C# console applications developed as part of a programming course. Each exercise focuses on specific programming fundamentals such as input/output, conditionals, loops, lists, and functions.

## Exercises Overview

### Exercise 1: Input and Output
Prompts the user for their first and last name and displays it in the format:  
`Your name is last-name, first-name last-name.`

### Exercise 2: Conditional Statements
Asks the user to input a grade percentage and determines the corresponding letter grade (Aâ€“F). Displays a message based on whether the user passed or not.

### Exercise 3: Guess My Number Game
Generates a random number between 1 and 100. The user repeatedly guesses until the number is found. The program gives hints like "Higher" or "Lower".

### Exercise 4: Working with Lists
Collects a list of integers entered by the user. Computes and displays the sum, average, and the maximum value of the list.

### Exercise 5: Functions and Methods
Demonstrates the use of static methods. Greets the user, asks for their name and favorite number, calculates the square of the number, and displays the result.
